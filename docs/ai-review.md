#Step 1: project setup

The project setup is completed. the files were generated by the prompt, and it followed the structure and rules defined in the prompt.

There are some issues that need to be addressed:

1. improve the fixture to use a js file instead of a json file to store the test data.
2. standarize naming conventions early on to avoid confusion.
3. Add a lightweight barrel export for pages and flows.
4. we needed to improve the playwright configuration
   a. add use.screenshot configuration
   b. add use.video configuration
   c. use html reporter
5. move the base url to playwright.config.js
6. add Prettier for consistent code style

#Step 2: app exploration

The app exploration is completed. the flows were identified and documented in the e2e-test-flows.md file.

The IA could have been more thorough in identifying all the possible flows and their risk levels. but I made some changes into the risk classification to make it more accurate.

I change the risk classification in the flows Cart Operations and Product Management from Medium to High. this because these flows are critical to the application and should be tested more frequently.

and the other flows do not test complete flows, they are just testing single actions. and the ability to move through all the products and the posibility to change the quantity of products in the cart is important to test.

#step 3: test implementation (Complete Checkout Flow)

the test implementation is completed. the test is passing and the report is generated.

The IA generated the test code but it was not following the structure and rules defined in the prompt, It was capable to identify the flows and create the test code following the structure and rules defined in the prompt, but all the flow was generated in one file, I had to split the logic into several flow files to make it more maintainable.

Also the locator weren't accurate and I had to fix it to follow the best practices.

It algo use the function goto to move between pages, but it should click on the link or button to move between pages. it was fixed

#step4 test implementation (Product Managment)

the test implementation is completed. the test is passing and the report is generated.

The IA kept making the same mistakes as in the previous step, it was not following the structure and rules defined in the prompt, and it was not splitting the logic into several flow files to make it more maintainable, I need improve those chnages and I need to make the prompt more clear to avoid this.

The IA also made up a test that was failing due to the feature is not working as expected, but the test was correct, it should be a suggestion to improve the feature.
