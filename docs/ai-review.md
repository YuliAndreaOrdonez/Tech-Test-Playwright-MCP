#Step 1: project setup

The project setup is completed. the files were generated by the prompt, and it followed the structure and rules defined in the prompt.

There are some issues that need to be addressed:

1. improve the fixture to use a js file instead of a json file to store the test data.
2. standarize naming conventions early on to avoid confusion.
3. Add a lightweight barrel export for pages and flows.
4. we needed to improve the playwright configuration
   a. add use.screenshot configuration
   b. add use.video configuration
   c. use html reporter
5. move the base url to playwright.config.js
6. add Prettier for consistent code style


#Step 2: app exploration

The app exploration is completed. the flows were identified and documented in the e2e-test-flows.md file.

The IA could have been more thorough in identifying all the possible flows and their risk levels. but I made some changes into the risk classification to make it more accurate.

I change the risk classification in the flows Cart Operations and Product Management from Medium to High. this because these flows are critical to the application and should be tested more frequently.

and the other flows do not test complete flows, they are just testing single actions. and the ability to move through all the products and the posibility to change the quantity of products in the cart is important to test.
