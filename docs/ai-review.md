#Step 1: project setup

The project setup is completed. the files were generated by the prompt, and it followed the structure and rules defined in the prompt.

There are some issues that need to be addressed:

1. improve the fixture to use a js file instead of a json file to store the test data.
2. standarize naming conventions early on to avoid confusion.
3. Add a lightweight barrel export for pages and flows.
4. we needed to improve the playwright configuration
   a. add use.screenshot configuration
   b. add use.video configuration
   c. use html reporter
5. move the base url to playwright.config.js
6. add Prettier for consistent code style
